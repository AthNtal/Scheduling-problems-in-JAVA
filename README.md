# Scheduling-problems-in-JAVA
This is a project in which we deal with scheduling problems by using MAX PQ. It also contains reading from a file and writing to a new one. Furthermore, we collect experimental data from a random number generator. The language used on this project is Java.
Part A is about the constructors (processor.java, MAXPQ.java...).
To execute part B, run Greedy.java.
Part C is the algorithm of part B but we first sort the processed jobs (using mergesort).
To execute part D, run Comparisons.java.
